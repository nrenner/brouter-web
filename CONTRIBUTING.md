## Translations

`TL;DR` if you contribute to BRouter and add some translatable content, please make sure not to modify anything in `locales` folder, except `locales/en.json`. Full explanation below.

### How internationalization works

BRouter is translated using [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) library, via command `gulp i18next`. It extracts translatable elements into `locales/en.json` file (English version).

As soon as this file is modified, it must be uploaded to Transifex (manually) with the command `yarn push-transifex`.

Anyone can then translate BRouter directly on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/openstreetmap/brouter-web/) platform.

From time to time (eg. when preparing releases), we can update translated content with the command `yarn pull-transifex`. **It will overwrite all JSON files in `locales` directory**.

## License

BRouter is licensed under [MIT](LICENSE). Please make sure before adding any library that it is compatible with that. (GPL licenses are incompatible for instance).
